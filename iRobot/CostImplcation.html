<h2>Potential Costs</h2>
       <p>The incremental costs of producing autonomous vehicles are uncertain. They require a variety of special sensors, computers and controls, which currently cost tens of thousands of dollar but are likely to become cheaper with mass production (KPMG 2012).  However, because system failures could be fatal to both vehicle occupants and other road users, all critical components will need to meet high manufacturing, installation, repair, testing and maintenance standards, similar to aircraft components, and so will probably be relatively expensive. Autonomous vehicle operation may require special navigation and mapping service subscriptions (which explains Google Corporation’s interest in this technology). Other, simpler technologies add hundreds of dollars to vehicle retail prices. For example, GPS and telecommunications systems, review cameras, and automatic transmissions typically cost $500 to $2,000. Navigation and security services such as OnStar and TomTom have $200 to $350 annual fees. Autonomous vehicles require these plus other equipment and service</p>
       <h2>Potential Benefits </h2>
       <p>Advocates predict that autonomous vehicles will provide significant user convenience, safety, congestion reductions, fuel savings, and pollution reduction benefits. Such claims many be overstated. For example, advocates argue that because driver error contributes to more than 90% of traffic accidents, self-driving cars will reduce crashes 90% (KPMG 2012; Fagnant and Kockelman 2013), including system failures (“death by computer”), cyberterrorism (Bilger 2013), offsetting behavior (road users’ tendency to take additional risks when they feel safer; also called risk compensation) and rebound effects (increased vehicle travel resulting from faster or cheaper travel) (Ecenbarger 2009; Fung 2015; Kockelman, et al. 2016; Lin 2013; Ohnsman 2014). If they feel safer, vehicle occupants may reduce seatbelt use, other road users may become less cautious, vehicles may operate faster and closer together, and human drivers may be tempted to join autonomous vehicle platoons, which will introduce new risks and enforcement requirements</p>
<p>If General Motors developed technology like Microsoft, motor vehicles would have the following characteristics:  
1. Automobiles would frequently crash for no apparent reason. This would be so common that motorists would simply accept it, restart their car and continue driving</p>
<p> Occasionally, for no reason, all doors would lock, and motorists could only enter their vehicle by simultaneously lifting the door handle, turning the key, and holding the radio antenn</p>
       <p>Vehicles would occasionally shut down completely and refuse to restart, requiring motorists to reinstall their engine</p>
       <p>Every time GM introduced a new model, car buyers would have to relearn to drive because all controls would operate in a new manner.</p>
       <p>Whenever roadway lines are repainted motorists would need to purchase a new car that accommodates the new “operating system.”</p>
       <p>Cars could normally carry only one passenger unless the driver paid extra for a multi-passenger license.</p>
       <p>Apple would make a car powered by the sun, more reliable, five times as fast, that required half the effort to drive, but could operate on just five per cent of roads.  
<p>Oil, water temperature and alternator warning lights would be replaced by a single 'general car default' warning light. </p> 
<p>Airbags would ask, 'Are you sure?' before deployment.</p>  
<p>Vehicle buyers would be required to also purchase a set of deluxe road maps from RandMcNally (a GM subsidiary), regardless of whether or not they want it. A trained mechanic would be required to delete them from the glove compartment. </p>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
<h2>Autonomous Vehicle Equipment and Service Requirement</h2>
<p> Automatic transmissions. 
 Diverse and redundant sensors (optical, infrared, radar, ultrasonic and laser) capable of operating in diverse conditions (rain, snow, unpaved roads, tunnels, etc.). 
 Wireless networks. Short range systems for vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and long-range systems to access to maps, software upgrades, road condition reports, and emergency messages. 
 Navigation, including GPS systems and special maps.  
 Automated controls (steering, braking, signals, etc.) 
 Servers, software and power supplies with high reliability standards.  
 Additional testing, maintenance and repair costs for critical components such as sensors and controls. 
 </p>
<p>Autonomous vehicles can be programed to optimize occupant comfort. Le Vine, Zolfaghari and Polak (2015) argue that because vehicle passengers tend to be more sensitive to acceleration than drivers, and occupants use travel time to work or rest (autonomous vehicle illustrations often show occupants playing cards or sleeping) it is plausible that for comfort sake users will program their vehicle for lower acceleration/deceleration characteristics than human-powered vehicles, leading to reductions in total urban roadway capacity. </p>
