<h2>Weakness:</h2>
<p>•Improper testing in the simulation environment</p> 
<p>•Environmental Weather related issues.</p>
<p>. Unsatable supply Chain </p>

<h2>Strength::</h2>
<p>Avoid false alrm.</p>
<p>Effective communication</p>
<p>enlarge your knowledge about the underlying forces and paths that will shape the future of autonomous vehicle.</p>

<h2Threats:</h2>
<p>Hackers and developers are locked in a perpetual duel. One attacking; the other parrying their lunge. It is a fight that is moving into the automotive domain as cars become more connected and technologically advanced. Adopting appropriate controls alongside the technology is essential to protect drivers of the future from cyber threats.</p>

<h2>Misconceptions:</h2>
<p>Driver assistance systems will evolve gradually into fully autonomous cars.</p>
<p>The first models of fully autonomous cars will be targeted to the consumer and will be available for purchase</p>
<p>It will take decades until most of the vehicles on the road are capable of autonomous driving</p>
<p>Self-driving cars are controlled by classical computer algorithms (if-then rules)</p>
<p>Public demonstrations of self-driving cars provide an indication of their capabilities</p>
         <p> Self-driving cars need to make the right ethical judgments</p>
         <p>convince us that they are safe, self-driving cars must drive hundreds of millions of miles</p>
